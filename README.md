## Features

- 🎥 **Dashcam.** Record whenever the car is on, or only while driving. Choose clip
length, quality, frame rate, and optional cabin audio.
- 👁️ **Parked surveillance.** Save activity around the car in Smart mode, or keep
recording while parked in Continuous mode. Arm on ignition off or locking, with
an optional red screen deterrent.
- ▶️ **Live and playback.** View all four cameras together or pick an individual
angle. Browse recordings and surveillance events in separate libraries.
- 💾 **Your storage.** Save to internal storage, SD, or USB. Give recordings and
surveillance their own space limits; the oldest finished clips rotate out.
- 📱 **Access from your phone.** Open the dashboard on your local network, or use
your own domain with an optional Cloudflare tunnel.

Footage is stored on the car, and detection runs on the head unit. Remote access
is optional. Strike has no account or subscription of its own.

Recording, surveillance, and live view share one camera feed. Strike uses hardware
video encoding on supported head units and only runs the live encoder while
someone is watching. Motion checks limit how often Smart surveillance runs person
and vehicle detection.

## Built lean

- 📦 **One APK, about 14 MB.** No companion app, no Play services, no installer.
- 🧩 **Four dependencies.** core-ktx, coroutines, `dadb` for the local ADB
connection, and TensorFlow Lite for detection.
- ⚡ **An interface of about 230 KB.** Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No
framework, no bundler, no build step, no CDN, and no remote fonts, so every
screen loads with the car offline.
- 🔒 **No telemetry, analytics, or crash reporting.** The only address Strike calls
on its own is GitHub's release API, at most once a day.



## Get started

1. Download **Strike.apk** from the [latest release](https://github.com/sp-hy/Strike/releases/latest)
  and install it on the head unit.
2. Open Strike and grant storage and microphone permissions. Audio is recorded
  only when you enable cabin audio.
3. Enable the head unit's ADB access, then select **Daemons → Connect** if needed
  and accept the debugging prompt. Strike restarts once after initial access and
   permissions are ready.
4. Open **Recordings → Settings** if you want to change clip length, quality, or
  storage. New installs default to continuous recording on the SD card with a
  20 GB space limit.
5. The **Recorder** daemon starts automatically once shell access is ready (and
  again after reboot). Use **Daemons** if you need to stop or restart it.
6. For parked recording, open **Surveillance → Settings**, enable **Watch the car
  when it is off**, and choose Smart or Continuous mode.



## Compatibility

Strike targets the **BYD Shark 6** (DiLink 5, SA8155P) head unit on 64-bit ARM
with local ADB access. Camera capture uses FastCam (`libfast_cam_capture` +
`@fast_cam.sock`) with hardware camera map `8,9,5,4`. Identify the vehicle via
`ro.vehicle.type` containing `DXF`, or a Shark camera profile — not `Build.MODEL`
alone (often `BYD AUTO`).

Legacy AVMCamera / panoramic-strip profiles (Atto, Seal, Tang) are not supported
in this build. Live **All** uses the FastCam 2×2 mosaic (logical camera 4). Keep
the OEM 360 app closed while Strike is recording.

Scratch files live under `Android/data/com.strike/files/daemon` (Shark /
Overdrive). Capture runs from the APK native library directory, never from
emulated storage.

A phone or emulator can show the interface but cannot provide the car's cameras.
Automatic parked operation requires working ignition readings. Local ADB must be
available on port 5555 and authorized on the head unit.



## Access from your phone

On the car's **Online** page, copy a local address and open it on a phone or
computer that can reach the car's network. Enter the **Browser access** code
shown in the car. The browser remembers the session for 90 days.

This code protects both local and remote access. Regenerating it signs out all
browsers. The optional in-car PIN in **Settings → Security** is separate. Local addresses use HTTP, so use a
trusted network.

In the browser's Live view, choose **Low data**, **Balanced**, or **High** stream
quality. This leaves recorded clips unchanged. If several browsers are watching,
the lowest selected quality applies to the shared live stream.

Set up Cloudflare with your own domain

1. Add your domain to Cloudflare and create a dedicated Cloudflare Tunnel.
2. Copy the tunnel token from the connector installation command.
3. Add a published application route for a hostname such as `car.example.com`,
  with **HTTP** service `127.0.0.1:8090`.
4. In **Online → Cloudflare tunnel → Settings**, enter the hostname and token,
  choose when it should run, and select **Save**.
5. Turn on the tunnel and open `https://car.example.com/`. Enter Strike's browser
  access code. You can also put Cloudflare Access in front of it.

Use a separate tunnel for emulator testing. If two devices run the same tunnel
token, Cloudflare can send requests to either device.

The tunnel can run **Always**, when the **Car is off**, or **On lock**. On lock
requires a confirmed lock reading. Automatic modes stop if ignition readings are
unavailable. The same tunnel switch appears in **Daemons**; turning it off cancels
automatic starts too. Tunnel controls and setup are available from the car;
browsers show their status.

The head unit must stay awake and have internet access. The tunnel cannot wake
the car. Playback depends on upload speed and browser codec support. Review
[Cloudflare's video delivery policy](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/policies-compliances/delivering-videos-with-cloudflare/)
before using Live or recordings through a public tunnel hostname.



## Recording while parked

**Smart** saves activity when a person or vehicle comes close. Each confirmed
event keeps recording for another 20 seconds. Continued activity stays recorded,
splitting into clips of about two minutes. The red screen can hide while the clip
is still recording. Between events, motion detection stays on while the recording
encoder is idle.

**Continuous** records throughout the armed period using the configured clip
length. Parked clips do not include cabin audio. If lock state is unavailable,
surveillance's On lock mode falls back after 60 seconds of confirmed parking.

Parked capture uses power to keep the cameras and head unit awake. Battery use
has not been measured across vehicles. A sudden power cut can leave the clip
being written unplayable.

## Updates

Open **Settings → Updates** to check, download, and install a release. Strike
checks GitHub when opened or resumed, at most once a day. You choose when to
download and install.

The updater finishes the current clip before installation and restores recording
afterward if it was running. If the clip cannot finish, installation is cancelled.
Settings, the in-car PIN, browser access code, remembered browser sessions, and
saved footage are kept. Uninstalling Strike or clearing its app data resets the
PIN and browser access. In-app installation needs authorized ADB
access and an APK signed with the same key as the installed version.

## PIN recovery

Forgot the in-car PIN?

Select **Forgot PIN?** below the lock-screen keypad for these instructions. From
a computer with an authorized ADB connection to the head unit, run:

```powershell
adb shell touch /sdcard/Android/data/com.strike/files/daemon/.strike_pin_reset
```

Reopen or refresh Strike, then set a new PIN under **Settings → Security**.
This clears the PIN and failed-attempt lockout. Recordings and other settings
are kept.

## Credits

This is a Shark-focused fork of [Strike](https://github.com/UnrealSalty/Strike) by
UnrealSalty, the original app this build is based on. Thanks to UnrealSalty for
the dashcam, surveillance, and web interface it started from.

Strike builds on [Overdrive](https://github.com/yash-srivastava/Overdrive-release)'s
work on BYD camera access, vehicle integration, and parked operation. It also
reuses assets from that project, including the car graphic and bundled detection
model. Thanks to Yash Srivastava and the Overdrive contributors.

Overdrive is not required to install or build Strike. Third-party components keep
their upstream licenses; see [Overdrive's notices](https://github.com/yash-srivastava/Overdrive-release/blob/main/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md)
